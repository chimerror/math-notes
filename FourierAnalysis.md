Notes on Fourier Series

Functions, Generally
--------------------

A *function* is a mapping from its *domain* to its *range*. The domain and range are sets of numbers, for our purposes, drawn from $\mathbb{R}$, the set of all real numbers.

A function may defined by specifying the domain, along with a *formula* that defines the range given an element of the domain. For example:

$$
f(x)=x\cdot\sin(x), \forall x\in\mathbb{R}
$$

In this case, the domain is $\mathbb{R}$, as defined following the comma. Usually if the domain is the entirety of $\mathbb{R}$ like this, it will not be explicitly mentioned. This is also the case for well-known functions, such as $\tan(x)$ and other trigonometric functions.

The range, then, is the set of possible values when a member of the domain is substituted into the formula. In the above case, this is also the entirety of \mathbb{R}. However if instead we had:

$$
g(x)=5\sin(x)
$$

As the possible values for $\sin(x)$ vary from 1 at the most, and -1 at the least, its range is $[-1,1]$. Multiplying by 5 widens the range of $g(x)$ to $[-5,5]$.
