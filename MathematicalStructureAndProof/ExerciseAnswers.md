### Exercise 1.1

Show that

$$
\{ n \in \mathbb{N} \mid n \text{ is odd and } n = k(k + 1) \text { for some } k \in \mathbb{N} \}
$$

is empty.

#### Answer

Any given $k \in \mathbb{N}$ is either odd or even and $k + 1$ is the opposite. That is, $k + 1$ for an odd $k$ is even,
and it is odd for an even $k$. Thus, $k(k + 1)$ will always be an odd number multiplied by an even number, and
therefore, through the even multiplicand, be itself divisible by 2 and thus even. So no $k(k + 1)$ will ever be odd,
meaning there are no possible elements of the set in question, and thus the set is empty.
